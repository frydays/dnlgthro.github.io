            <h3>My design background</h3>
            <p>There is no coding, web design, or graphic design in my background. Instead, my background is in education, libraries, and information studies. Through my MLIS degree I have been slowly gaining experience with web development, design, and metadata. This portfolio will serve as a gallery to showcase those growing skills.</p>
               
        
            <h3>My work and education</h3>
        <p>Currently, I am working towards completing an MLIS degree, but prior to that I completed a Bachelor of Arts degree. After that I received an education degree and travelled to London, UK to teach secondary school (and to travel, a bit). My full education credentials are as follows: </p>
